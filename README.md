Hi, I'm Mukesh 👋
I am a Backend-end Developer.

I strive while utilising both the logical and creative part of the brain. I feel most in my place while continuously operating in these roles as a back-end developer within a team. I stand for quality, innovation and building useful products with a focus on the human using the product. I am a proactive, confident and communicatively strong person always looking ahead in the future.
